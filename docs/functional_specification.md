# Functional Specification

### Background

It has been established that air pollution and health effects associated with it disproportionately affect poorer people and some racial and ethnic groups. With the advent of the PurpleAir air quality monitoring network in 2015, a variety of consumers within the governmental, industry, and educational sectors as well as citizen scientists and home enthusiasts have been able to record and share localized air quality data. PurpleAir air quality sensors are relatively cheap (~$250), providing more localized, more current, though less accurate readings compared to AirNow, an air quality network managed through the partnership of multiple government entities. Seattleâ€™s PurpleAir network has expanded with the occurrence of wildfire smoke the past few years. Purple Haze is an analysis project to answer the following questions:

1. Is the distribution of PurpleAir sensors in Seattle equitable?
2. Are people of disadvantaged socioeconomic status or race disproportionately affected by poor air quality?

### User Profiles

Our primary users are researchers. The researchers will use our package to easily interface with both datasets and uncover relationships between combined metrics. The researcher is a user of Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab and can program in Python.

#### Example User Profile Number One:
Rea Elprup, Unpaid summer intern, PurpleAir
* wants to know who in Seattle is buying sensors
* wants to know some demographic info about where the sensors are being installed to inform future expansion

#### Example User Profile Number Two:
Bess Twishes, Grad Student, UW
* studying the effects of air quality on residents in formerly red-lined neighborhoods
* wondering if PurpleAir can provide some hyper-local data that is not available from other sources
 

### Data Sources

#### PurpleAir
PurpleAir is an air quality monitoring network maintained by their low-cost air quality monitors purchased by organizations, citizen scientists, and home enthusiasts. PurpleAir air quality monitors use laser counters to measure particulate matter in real time. As a single particle passes through a laser, some of scattered laser light off of the particle will hit a detection plate, where the length of the laser light pulse determines particle size and the number of laser light pulses determines particle counts. Some assumptions in particle density and shape are employed to convert laser pulse length to particle mass concentration. The PurpleAir air quality monitor uses two lasers for data output, Channel A and Channel B, to ensure air quality measurements are precise.

For each PurpleAir air quality monitor, which we will now refer to as "sensor," the data is available as four separate CSV files named with the following format: ``Sensor Name _ (Location) (Latitude Longitude) Order #_minute_average mm_dd_yyyy mm_dd_yyyy.csv`` where:
* Sensor Name is an owner-named property
* _ is used to designate the laser channel, either left blank for Channel A or `B` for Channel B
* Location is `outside`, `inside`, or `undefined` 
* Latitude is the sensor's latitude in degrees
* Longitude is the sensor's longitude in degrees
* Order is `Primary` or `Secondary`
* \# is the number of minutes averaged
* The first mm_dd_yyyy is the data start date
* The second mm_dd_yyyy is the data end date

The four CSV files are created as the following pairs:
1. Channel A and Primary
2. Channel A and Secondary
3. Channel B and Primary
4. Channel B and Secondary

Primary files contain the following variables, where CF denotes indoor/controlled (1) or outdoor (ATM) particle densities:
* Creation time (yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss UTC)
* PM1.0 (CF=1) (ug/m3)
* PM2.5 (CF=1) (ug/m3)
* PM10.0 (CF=1) (ug/m3)
* Uptime (Minutes)
* RSSI (WiFi Signal Strength)
* Temperature (F)
* Humidity (%)
* PM2.5 (CF=ATM) (ug/m3)

Secondary files contain the following variables:
* Creation time (yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss UTC)
* 0.3um (particles/deciliter)
* 0.5um (particles/deciliter)
* 1.0um (particles/deciliter)
* 2.5um (particles/deciliter)
* 5.0um (particles/deciliter)
* 10.0um (particles/deciliter)
* PM1.0 (CF=ATM) (ug/m3)
* PM10 (CF=ATM) (ug/m3) 

For our analysis project, we chose to include all PurpleAir sensors located and operating within Seattle from May 1 to November 1, 2020 and chose our output as 60-minute averaged data.

#### Seattle's Racial and Social Equity Composite Index
Seattle is a city with an Open Data Program, a program whose purpose is to make data created by the city of Seattle publicly accessible. One of these publicly available datasets is the Racial and Social Equity Composite Index (RSECI). Information on race, ethnicity, and other demographics are combined with socioeconomic and health disadvantages data to locate where priority populations are residing. 

The following demographic, socioeconomic, and health metrics are provided by the city of Seattle at the census tract level:
* Adults diagnosed with diabetes (percent and percentile)
* Adults that are obese (percent and percentile)
* Adults with asthma (percent and percentile)
* Adults with disabilities (percent and percentile)
* Adults with no leisure-time physical activity (percent and percentile)
* Adults with poor mental health (percent and percentile)
* Composite Index (percentile and quintile)
* Educational attainment less than a bachelor's degree (percent and percentile)
* English language learner (percent and percentile)
* Foreign born (percent and percentile)
* Health Index (percentile and quintile)
* Income below 200 percent of poverty (percent and percentile)
* Low life expectancy at birth (percent and percentile)
* People of color (percent and percentile)
* Race, English Language Learners Index (percentile and quintile)
* Socioeconomic Index (percentile and quintile)

This data is provided in a variety of formats (e.g. GeoJSON, CSV, KML, shapefile, etc.), but for this analysis project, we have chosen to use shapefile output due to its ease of use with producing visualizations of Seattle's census tracts. The file can be downloaded as a .zip folder containing 5 files to make up the shapefile: a .cpg file containing the codepage information, a .dbf file storing the RSECI metrics for each census tract, a .prj file storing the coordinate system information, a .shp file containing the census tract geometry, and a .shx file containing the census tract indexing.

### Use Cases

#### Use Case 1: I want to find out how the number of PurpleAir sensors within a census tract in Seattle depends on demographic, socioeconomic, and health metrics. 
* The user will be able to perform their own data analysis with the Jupyter Notebook to make inquiries within our GeoPandas dataframe.
* The user can also view their analysis work in one clean application with Voila.
* The user can look at premade plots to see a map of sensor distribution in Seattle, grouped by census tract, and can compare how the sensor density is related to socioeconomic metrics.

#### Use Case 2: I want to explore the relation between a census tract's mean AQI and a census tract's socioeconomic, demographic, and health metrics. 
* The user will hover over a census tract in our interactive map of Seattle and will generate a tooltip containing the census tract identification number and other useful information.
* The user can select an AQI option and a socioeconomic option as dropdowns to be plotted on a scatter chart.
